/*
    Checked Exceptions:
        Exceptions that Java compiler forces us to handle explicitly.
        Either by catching them or declaring them with throws.

        Beyond program control. E.g. file I/O error, network issues,
        database access problems.
        E.g., IOException, SQLException, ClassNotFoundException

        throws keyword is compulsory.

    Unchecked Exceptions:
        Compiler does not force you to handle these exceptions.

        Logic errors, improper data handling.

        E.g., ArithmeticException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException,
            NullPointerException
