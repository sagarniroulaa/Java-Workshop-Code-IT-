    // Polymorphism -> One method, different forms

    /*
    Why Polymorphism?
    -> Reduces code duplication.
    -> Performs single action in different ways.
    additionOfIntegers
    funct(int a, int b)
    additionOfDouble
    funct(double c, double d, double e)

   Types of Polymorphism
   1. Compile-time Polymorphism (Static Binding/Early Binding)
   -> Achieved using method overloading.
   -> which method to call is decided by compiler at compile time.

   2. Runtime Polymorphism (Dynamic Binding/Late Binding)
   -> Achieved using method overriding.
   -> which method to call is decided by JVM at runtime.
   -> Uses dynamic method dispatch.
