/*
    Interfaces:
    1. Contract, that implementing classes must follow.
    2. Can include abstract, default, static, private methods.
    3. All variables are implicitly public, static and final.
    4. Cannot have constructors.
    5. They support multiple inheritance.
    5. No instance variable (only constants).
    6. Methods are implicitly public, abstract.

    Abstract Classes:
    1. Can have both concrete and abstract methods.
    2. Can declare instance variables.
    3. Doesn't support multiple inheritance.
    4. Can have constructors.
    5. Code share.
