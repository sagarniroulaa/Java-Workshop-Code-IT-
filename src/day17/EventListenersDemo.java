/*
    Event Listeners (Interfaces):
        -> Also an object, that is notified when an event occurs.
        -> Two major requirements:
            1. Must be registered.
            2. Must implement methods to receive and process those
            events.

    E.g. ActionListener -> ActionEvent
    MouseListener,
    MouseMotionListener

    Event Classes:
        -> EventObject is the superclass of all events.
        -> "java.util" package.
        -> AWTEvent is the subclass of EventObject.
        -> "java.awt" package.
        -> AWTEvent ->
            ActionEvent, InputEvent(MouseEvent, KeyEvent), WindowEvent,
            FocusEvent, ItemEvent, TextEvent
